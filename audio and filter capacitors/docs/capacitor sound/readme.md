### Cyril Bateman's Capacitor Sound articles



During 2002 and 2003 Electronics World published a slew of articles by Cyril Bateman on capacitor distortion, dielectric absorption and several other subjects. The series also detailed his purpose-build test equipment and was published under the title 'Capacitor Sound'.

This was a landmark series and is still read and consulted frequently.  
I asked Cyril to write an update for Linear Audio, addressing new findings and products since the publications of the series, and he kindly agreed.  
The new article appeared in Linear Audio Volume 9.  
  
Sadly, Cyril passed away early 2015 after a life of contributing to technical progress.
